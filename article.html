                FF7R is a refreshed PS4 version of one of the most popular JRPGs ever released. The game was developed
                by Square Enix. The creators of Final Fantasy 7 Remake tried to make it feel like the original as much
                as possible. So we get a classic Japanese RPG in which we explore locations, interact with NPCs, develop
                one's character, and fight. However, some elements have been adapted to the modern game design formula -
                combat is much more dynamic, for that matter. With the complete reconstruction of the visuals, a better
                balance of realism and styling was put in place. To avoid omitting anything from the original
                production, it was decided to release the game in several parts.

            <h2 id="story">Story in Final Fantasy 7 Remake</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Final Fantasy 7 Remake is set in a world combining elements of science fiction and fantasy, known as
                Gaia. The life energy of this planet is extracted by a company called Shinra. This can lead to complete
                destruction of the world. The main character is Cloud Strife - an ex-soldier who now works as a
                mercenary. He joins the Avalanche resistance to fight against this corporation.
                <br> <br>
                The entire plot is divided into parts, and the first of them takes place in Midgar - a city that serves
                as the headquarters of the Shinra Corporation.<br> <br>
            </p>

            <h2 id="structure">How does the episodic structure of the game work?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Unlike the original game, Final Fantasy 7 Remake has an episodic structure. This means that the game
                won't offer the entire story from the original, but only a part of it.
                <br><br>
                FF7 Remake was divided into a number of smaller parts that will be sold as separately. Each of these
                episodes contains a fragment of the story of the original game. Thanks to this, the developers can
                expand the plot by adding new characters.
                <br><br>
                At the moment, only the release date of the first part is known. We also know that the works on the
                second part have begun. It is still unknown, however, how many episodes the remake will get.
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2 id="pcrelease">Will Final Fantasy 7 Remake be released on PC?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Final Fantasy 7 Remake was announced only on PlayStation 4. However, some of the Square Enix games have
                been released on PC after some time. This has happened with Dragon Quest Builders 2 released in 2019.
                Thus, it is likely that this situation will repeat.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h2 id="edition">Final Fantasy 7 Remake - editions</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In addition to the regular edition, the developers have also prepared two editions with additional
                content.
            <ul>
                <li>Deluxe Edition</li>
                <br>The Deluxe Edition includes a steelbook, artbook, a CD with the game's soundtrack and Summon Materia
